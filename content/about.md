About
=========================

#### Game Overflow

This website is designed with the intention of creating a Stack Overflow clone.  The theme of Game Overflow is of course anything to do with gaming.  After logging on, a user can ask a question, answer an already asked question and comment on current questions and answers.  There is a Game Tag service which shows recent images and videos of the tagged/searched game.  There is also a ranking system for all content, where a user can vote up or down a question, answer and comment.  The rank of the content owner will increase each time content they created is voted up, where higher ranked content gets the owner an even higher ranking.  This is based upon a secret points system.  The overview page show the top three ranked users along with their rank.  A user cannot vote for their own content or administrate other user's content.  One answer for every question can be chosen as an accepted answer by clicking on the star icon to the left of the answer.  I hope you enjoy Game Overflow and please message me if you find any problems.
